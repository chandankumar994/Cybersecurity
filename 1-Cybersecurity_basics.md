# 🔐 Cybersecurity Basics for Beginners

## 1. What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity means protecting yourself (your devices, data, and online identity) from digital attacks—just like locking your home to keep out thieves.

👉 Think of your phone/computer as your *house*, and your password as the *key*.
If someone gets your key, they can enter and take your stuff. Cybersecurity helps you keep your digital house safe.

## 2. Common Threats (with Simple Examples)

### 2.1 **Phishing** 🎣

Attackers trick you into giving information (like passwords or bank details) by pretending to be someone you trust.

* **Example:** You get an email saying *“Your bank account will be blocked! Click here to verify.”*
  If you click, it leads to a fake website that steals your password.

**How to protect yourself:**
✅ Check the sender’s email address carefully.
✅ Don’t click suspicious links.
✅ Banks never ask for passwords over email.

### 2.2 **Weak Passwords** 🔑

Using simple passwords like `123456`, `password`, or your name makes it very easy for hackers.

**Example:** If your Facebook password is `rahul123`, anyone who knows your name can guess it.

**How to protect yourself:**
✅ Use long, unique passwords: *RaHuL\@2025!Love\$Movies*
✅ Use a **password manager** (like Bitwarden or LastPass) so you don’t need to remember all.

### 2.3 **Public Wi-Fi Risks** ☕📶

Free Wi-Fi in cafes, airports, or malls can be unsafe. Hackers on the same network can steal your data.

**Example:** You connect to “Free\_Cafe\_WiFi” and log in to your bank. A hacker could capture your login info.

**How to protect yourself:**
✅ Avoid logging into banks on public Wi-Fi.
✅ Use VPN apps when possible.

---

### 2.4 **Malware (Viruses, Trojans, Ransomware)** 🦠

Malware is harmful software that can enter your device through fake apps, downloads, or email attachments.

* **Example:** You download a “free movie” app. It secretly installs malware that steals your photos or locks your files.

**How to protect yourself:**
✅ Only download apps from official stores (Google Play, App Store).
✅ Keep antivirus updated.
✅ Don’t open unknown attachments.

## 3. Golden Rules of Cyber Safety (Easy to Remember)

1. **Think before you click** – Most scams need you to click. Don’t make it easy.
2. **Lock everything** – Use PINs, passwords, fingerprint locks.
3. **Update regularly** – Software updates fix security holes.
4. **Backup your data** – Keep a copy of important files. If ransomware hits, you won’t lose everything.
5. **Be skeptical** – If an offer sounds “too good to be true,” it usually is.
